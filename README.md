# Math Plotter

A graphing tool which makes plotting objects into a parallel perspective 3D coordinate system simple.

This program can be used to visualize points / objects / vectors like in math schoolbooks.

Developed for an so-called "GFS" (Gleichwertige Feststellung von Sch√ºlerleistungen) presentation in math at school.

# Features
-zoom-in, zoom-out, move
